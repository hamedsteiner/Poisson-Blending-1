# Poisson-Blending

Poisson Blending Implementation in MATLAB 

## Getting Started

Poisson Blending was implemented with sparse matrix to solve the linear equation (Ax=b). It can
handle gray or RGB image by recursive method. The error sum showed very small number.

### Prerequisites

This project is tested on MATLAB 2018

```
MATLAB2018 
```

### Run
Select background and target images in main.m, then execute main.m
Default images in 'image' folder
```
main
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
